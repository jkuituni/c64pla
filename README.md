# c64pla
Custom Commodore 64 PLA implementation in VHDL

Based on a Commodore 64 'c' version PLA implementation with additional features being implemented for additional BASIC ROM, 
CPU speed control and bus arbitration, RTC, IDE and rs232 chips in the I/O mirrors of the original decoding as well as support 
for memory banking for additional CPU-only RAM area. This implementation will not work on a standard Commodore 64. Requires 
extensive hardware modifications. 

This is work-in-progress project
