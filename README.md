# c64pla
Implementation of the SuperPLA in the c64 'c' version in VHDL done together with Frank Buss. Note, that this version does work only as the normal SuperPLA (chip number 251715), not the one with integrated color SRAM (chip number 252535).

This is a fork from the Frank Buss' repository as that is where the original work was done. For additional information check out the webpage about this project :
